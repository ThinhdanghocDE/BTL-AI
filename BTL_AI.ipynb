Tuy nhiên, nhóm gửi tiền có độ tuổi phân bố rộng hơn, đặc biệt xuất hiện nhiều hơn ở các nhóm tuổi từ 50 trở lên. Điều này cho thấy người lớn tuổi hơn có xu hướng gửi tiền cao hơn, có thể do họ có sự ổn định tài chính và nhu cầu tiết kiệm lớn hơn.\n",
        " 2. Balance (Số dư tài khoản)\n",
        "Cả hai nhóm đều có phần lớn khách hàng với số dư thấp. Tuy vậy, ở nhóm gửi tiền, có một số lượng đáng kể khách hàng có số dư cao hơn rất nhiều, lên đến hàng chục nghìn. Điều này cho thấy những khách hàng có số dư tài khoản cao thường có khả năng gửi tiền cao hơn – đây là một chỉ báo tài chính quan trọng cần được đưa vào mô hình dự đoán.\n",
        " 3. Day (Ngày gọi)\n",
        "Phân bố ngày gọi trong tháng ở hai nhóm gần như giống nhau và khá đồng đều. Không có sự khác biệt rõ rệt giữa khách hàng gửi và không gửi tiền theo ngày gọi. Vì vậy, thuộc tính này có thể ít tác động đến quyết định gửi tiền, hoặc không phải là yếu tố chính.\n",
        " 4. Month (Tháng gọi)\n",
        "Ở nhóm không gửi tiền, số lượng khách hàng tập trung rất nhiều trong tháng 5, cho thấy đây có thể là tháng chiến dịch gọi diễn ra mạnh nhưng không hiệu quả. Ngược lại, nhóm gửi tiền có phân bố đều hơn ở các tháng khác, như tháng 8 và 10. Điều này gợi ý rằng tháng gọi ảnh hưởng đến hiệu quả chiến dịch, và cần cân nhắc lại chiến lược tiếp cận trong từng thời điểm cụ thể.\n",
        " 5. Duration (Thời lượng cuộc gọi)\n",
        "Đây là một trong những thuộc tính thể hiện sự khác biệt rõ rệt nhất. Nhóm gửi tiền có nhiều cuộc gọi kéo dài hơn, trong khi nhóm không gửi chủ yếu là những cuộc gọi rất ngắn. Có thể thấy rằng thời lượng cuộc gọi càng dài thì khả năng thuyết phục khách hàng gửi tiền càng cao, do đó đây là yếu tố rất quan trọng để đưa vào mô hình AI.\n",
        " 6. Campaign (Số lần liên hệ trong chiến dịch)\n",
        "Khách hàng gửi tiền thường chỉ được liên hệ 1–2 lần, trong khi nhóm không gửi có nhiều người bị gọi nhiều hơn, thậm chí tới hơn 10 lần. Việc liên hệ quá nhiều có thể tạo cảm giác làm phiền, phản tác dụng. Do đó, số lần gọi hợp lý sẽ nâng cao hiệu quả chiến dịch.\n",
        " 7. Pdays (Số ngày kể từ lần gọi trước)\n",
        "Nhóm gửi tiền có phân bố rộng hơn ở thuộc tính pdays, nghĩa là họ đã từng được gọi trước đây và khoảng thời gian giữa các lần gọi không quá xa. Trong khi đó, nhóm không gửi chủ yếu có giá trị pdays cao hoặc đặc biệt (999), tức là chưa từng được gọi. Khách hàng đã từng được chăm sóc trước đó có xu hướng gửi tiền cao hơn, nên đây cũng là một chỉ báo tốt.\n",
        " 8. Previous (Số lần liên hệ trước chiến dịch hiện tại)\n",
        "Tương tự như pdays, nhóm gửi tiền có xu hướng đã từng được tiếp cận trong quá khứ. Nhóm không gửi tiền phần lớn chưa từng được liên hệ. Điều này tiếp tục khẳng định rằng lịch sử chăm sóc khách hàng là một yếu tố quan trọng giúp nâng cao tỷ lệ gửi tiền.\n",

Điều này hoàn toàn hợp lý vì những cuộc gọi dài thường thể hiện mức độ quan tâm hoặc sự thuyết phục thành công từ phía nhân viên tư vấn. Ngoài ra, các biến liên quan đến lịch sử tương tác như pdays và previous cũng cho thấy mối liên hệ tích cực với hành vi gửi tiền – nghĩa là nếu khách hàng từng được liên hệ trước đó, họ có xu hướng dễ đồng ý hơn. Ngược lại, biến campaign lại có tương quan âm, cho thấy việc gọi quá nhiều lần trong cùng một chiến dịch có thể gây phản tác dụng, khiến khách hàng cảm thấy phiền và từ chối. Những yếu tố như tuổi (age) hay số dư tài khoản (balance) có vẻ không ảnh hưởng nhiều, vì mức tương quan với biến mục tiêu là rất nhỏ. Tóm lại, nếu muốn xây dựng một mô hình dự đoán hiệu quả, ta nên tập trung vào những yếu tố thể hiện mức độ tương tác và hiệu quả của cuộc gọi hơn là thông tin cá nhân đơn thuần."

        "Biểu đồ hộp (boxplot) trên thể hiện cấu trúc của các biến số, có sử dụng thang đo log đối xứng cho trục tung (symlog):\n",
        "1. Vai trò của thang đo symlog: Việc sử dụng thang đo symlog giúp quan sát đồng thời các biến có thang đo rất nhỏ (ví dụ như campaign, previous) và các biến có thang đo rất lớn (ví dụ như balance, duration) một cách rõ ràng. Nếu sử dụng các thang đo tuyến tính thông thường thì các hộp của các biến có thang đo rất nhỏ như campaign, previous sẽ được biểu thị gần như là 1 đường thẳng, rất khó để quan sát.\n",
        "2. Sự khác biệt về độ phân tán (IQR - Thân hộp): Thân hộp (box) đại diện cho 50% dữ liệu nằm ở trung tâm (từ phân vị 25 đến 75 trong tứ phân vị). Nhìn vào biểu đồ bên trên, chúng ta quan sát được phần thân hộp của 2 biến số balance và duration lớn hơn đáng kể so với các biến age, campaign, pdays và previous, chứng tỏ rằng ngay cả phần dữ liệu cốt lõi của chúng cũng có độ phân tán và khoảng giá trị lớn hơn nhiều so với các biến số còn lại.\n",
        "3. Mức độ của các giá trị ngoại lai (Outliers - Các chấm tròn): Các chấm tròn bên ngoài râu của hộp xếp chồng lên nhau chính là các giá trị ngoại lai. Biến số balance có rất nhiều giá trị ngoại lai ở cả hai phía âm và dương, một số điểm vươn tới các giá trị cực kì lớn. 2 biến số duration và pdays cũng có nhiều giá trị ngoại lai đáng chú ý. Ngay cả 2 biến số có thang đo nhỏ như campaign và previous cũng tồn tại các giá trị ngoại lai.\n",
        "4. Kết luận: Dựa vào biểu đồ, chúng ta nhận thấy được cần phải thực hiện chuẩn hóa dữ liệu và có 2 vấn đề chính cần giải quyết:\n",
        "- Khác biệt thang đo: Độ lớn và độ phân tán của các biến là hoàn toàn khác nhau.\n",
        "- Tồn tại giá trị ngoại lai: Các giá trị ngoại lai có mặt ở hầu hết các biến và có thể làm sai lệch quá trình học của mô hình.\n",
        "Để giải quyết 2 vấn đề trên, chúng ta sẽ sử dụng RobustScaler, vì RobustScaler được thiết kế để xử lý hiệu quả cả 2 vấn đề này bằng cách sử dụng các đại lượng thống kê bền vững là median và IQR."

Với cột campaign, cũng tương tự, khoảng giữa là 1.0.
